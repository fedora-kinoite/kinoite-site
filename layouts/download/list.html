                Setting Fedora Kinoite up has never been easier.
                All you need is a ?GB flash drive and Fedora Media Writer.

                Once Fedora Media Writer is installed, simply use it to flash your
                drive. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, I have no idea if Kinoite has
                a live CD. Marketing is hard when you don't know what you're marketing.
