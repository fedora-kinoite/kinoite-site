    Setting Fedora Kinoite up has never been easier.
    All you need is a ?GB flash drive and Fedora Media Writer.

    Once Fedora Media Writer is installed, simply use it to flash your
    drive. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, I have no idea if Kinoite has
    a live CD. Marketing is hard when you don't know what you're marketing.
